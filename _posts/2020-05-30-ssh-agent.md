# Automatically register SSH keys

Guide to automatically add ssh private keys every time you startup your terminal.

## Prerequisits

First of all you need to generate a ssh key. There are lots of ways and encryptions to choose from. Here is an very simple example which usualy does the trick.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/<name_of_key>.key
```

> If you only type ssh-keygen -t rsa you will create a key named `id_rsa`. This key will automatically be used and this process is unnessesary.
