# Automatically Register SSH Keys on Terminal Startup

Managing SSH keys can be tedious if you have to add them manually every time you open a new terminal. This guide explains how to automatically add your SSH private keys when you start your terminal, making SSH connections seamless and secure.

## Prerequisites

First, you need to generate an SSH key. There are many encryption options, but here is a simple example that usually works for most cases:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/<name_of_key>.key
```

> If you only type `ssh-keygen -t rsa`, you will create a key named `id_rsa`. This key will automatically be used by SSH, so the following steps are unnecessary for that default key.

## Manually Adding SSH Keys

Normally, to use a custom SSH key, you need to start the SSH agent and add your key manually:

1. Start the SSH agent:

    ```bash
    eval $(ssh-agent)
    ```
    This will output the process ID of the agent.

2. Add your SSH key to the agent:

    ```bash
    ssh-add <path-and-filename-of-key>
    ```

## Automatically Adding SSH Keys with Keychain

A more convenient way is to use [keychain](https://www.funtoo.org/Keychain), a manager for `ssh-agent` that automatically loads your keys and makes them available to all your terminal sessions.

1. **Install keychain:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install keychain -y
    ```

2. **Add the following lines to your shell's rc file** (`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, usually in your home directory):

    ```bash
    keychain <keyname1> <keyname2>
    . ~/.keychain/$(uname -n)-sh
    ```

    For example:

    ```bash
    keychain github.key gitlab.key daKey
    . ~/.keychain/$(uname -n)-sh
    ```

    > Your SSH keys should be stored in the `~/.ssh/` folder for this to work.
    {: .prompt-tip }

3. **Restart your terminal.**

    You should see output similar to:

    ```
     * keychain 2.8.5 ~ http://www.funtoo.org
     * Found existing ssh-agent: 261
     * Known ssh key: /home/user/.ssh/key1.key
     * Known ssh key: /home/user/.ssh/key2.key
     * Known ssh key: /home/user/.ssh/gitlab
     * Known ssh key: /home/user/.ssh/bitbucket.key
     * Known ssh key: /home/user/.ssh/github.key
    ```

## Using the SSH Config File

You can also specify which key to use for each host by editing your `~/.ssh/config` file. This is useful if you use different keys for different services.

- **Example: Use `gitlab.key` for gitlab.com**

    ```
    Host gitlab.com
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gitlab.key
    ```

- **Example: Use a different username and key for an internal server**

    ```
    Host 192.168.1.*
        User root
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/servers.key
    ```

For more information, see the [official SSH documentation](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config).

## Summary

- Generate SSH keys with `ssh-keygen`.
- Use `ssh-agent` and `ssh-add` to manually add keys, or automate with `keychain`.
- Configure per-host keys in `~/.ssh/config` for advanced setups.
- For more details, check the [keychain documentation](https://www.funtoo.org/Keychain) and [SSH config manual](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config).
