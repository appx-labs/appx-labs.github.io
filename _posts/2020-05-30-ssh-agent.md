# Automatically register SSH keys

Guide to automatically add ssh private keys every time you startup your terminal.

## Prerequisits

First of all you need to generate a ssh key. There are lots of ways and encryptions to choose from. Here is an very simple example which usualy does the trick.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/<name_of_key>.key
```

> If you only type ssh-keygen -t rsa you will create a key named `id_rsa`. This key will automatically be used and this process is unnessesary.

## Usual steps to add SSH keys to your terminal
First of all you need to start the ssh-agent. You usually do this by this command:

```bash
eval $(ssh-agent)
```

This should output the process id.

Then you need to add the ssh key `~/.ssh/<SomeKey>` to the ssh-agent with the following command:

```bash
ssh-add <path-and-filename-of-key>
```

## Quick solution

There is a different way to do this. Add your keys to keychain. With this way you dont have to use `ssh-agent` nor `ssh-add` instead you need to add the following lines to your rc file depending on which shell you are using `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` most probably. This file should be located in your home folder. To get to your home folder you can type `cd` or `cd ~`

```bash
keychain <keyname1> <keyname2>
. ~/.keychain/`uname -n`-sh
```

Here is a example with real names to make it easier to grasp

```bash
keychain github.key gitlab.key daKey
. ~/.keychain/`uname -n`-sh
```

> To make this work you need to keep your ssh keys in `~/.ssh/` folder.

The last detail is to install keychain by executing the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install keychain -y
```

Now restart your terminal and you should see a text that tells you which ssh keys that are registered. Could look something like this:

```bash
 * keychain 2.8.5 ~ http://www.funtoo.org
 * Found existing ssh-agent: 261
 * Known ssh key: /home/user/.ssh/key1.key
 * Known ssh key: /home/user/.ssh/key2.key
 * Known ssh key: /home/user/.ssh/gitlab
 * Known ssh key: /home/user/.ssh/bitbucket.key
 * Known ssh key: /home/user/.ssh/github.key
```

## config way

There is also a way to do this by structuring the `.ssh/cofig` file

As an example, you want to use `gitlab.key` ssh file when connecting to gitlab.com. This can be done in the config file by adding the following text.

```
Host gitlab.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gitlab.key
```

Another example is if you want to connect to an internal server with another username. That can be done by the following.

```
Host 192.168.1.*
    User root
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/servers.key
```
