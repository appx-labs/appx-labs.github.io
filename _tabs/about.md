Finally got time to tinker around abit with my HomeLab and thought I would share some of the obstacles I've encountered.

## Things I'm hoping to post about

* DNS setup
* HCI (Hyper Convergent Infrastructure) setup
* Hackintosh on Type 1 hypervisor
* Reverse proxy with Traefik
* CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
* SSO (Single Sign-On)
* Architectural thoughts
